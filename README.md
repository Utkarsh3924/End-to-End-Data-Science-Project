# End to End Data Sceince Project

Developed and deployed an end-to-end student performance prediction model<br>
 * Built a machine learning model to predict student performance based on data such as reading and writing scores.
 * Implemented data cleaning, pre-processing and feature engineering to prepare data for model training. 
 * Evaluated model performance using various metrics to ensure generalizability and avoid over-fitting.
 * Hosted the model on a secure live server using AWS Beanstalk.
 * Designed a user-friendly web app using flask.
